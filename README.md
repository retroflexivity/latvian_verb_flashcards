# Flashcards for Latvian word forms

Learning Latvian word inflection might be hard for a foreigner. There are a lot of tools for learning languages, specifically flashcards like Anki or Memrise. However, if you want to learn word forms using a standard flashcard app, you need to add each form manually. This app changes this: a user only needs to add the infinitive form, and all other forms will be generated using [Tezaurs](tezaurs.lv) api.

Currently, only verbs are supported. Support for nouns etc. is a future task.

The target audience is beginner and intermediate leaners of Latvian who have struggle with learning word forms and look for a simple solution for it. In the app, a user can create decks of cards (words), and then study them. During a study session, the user sees a word in infinitive and need to inflect the word into a certain form. The app remembers which words the user guessed incorrectly and prioritizes them.

### Development plan
